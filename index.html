        -All chapters from 1-9 now have homework questions. About 2 hours of work remain after errors are resolved. See below for further details. 
        <br> <br>
        -Remainder of chapter 9 will not display on website.
        <br><br>
        -Chapter 4 was mostly asking for student opinion.
        <br><br>
        -The math questions have been converted to the best of my ability. The website lists "Error 404" for some vital graphs I need.
        <br> <br>
        -Math questions involving students drawing polynomial curves free-handed can not be done as of yet due to the cloze system. Because we ask students to plot the points, curves consist of infinite points. I am currently reading about how Cloze works, to find a solution.
        <br> <br>
        -All errors notes i was given have been implimented. After chapter 6 I read a book on how to design test questions to improve my work, so i could improve the previous ones further if we like the later questions. <br>
